Delegating LUNC grants validators voting power proportional to their stake. Validators collect commission on rewards while delegators earn the remainder. Typical commission settings range between 2.5% and 20%.

Governance proposals enter a seven-day voting phase once deposits reach the minimum threshold. Delegators can override validator votes through supported wallets.

## Delegate flow

1. Connect with Keplr, Galaxy Station or other supported wallets and review validator voting power and commission.
2. Delegate LUNC and monitor validator uptime to ensure they remain below slashing thresholds.
3. Redelegate proactively if a validator is unreliable or votes against your interests.
4. Vote on governance proposals before the deadline to direct network policy.
5. Observe the 21-day unbonding period when reallocating stake across validators.

> **Tip**
>
> Delegator votes **override** validator votes. The voting power from undelegated LUNC is not used to vote on proposals.

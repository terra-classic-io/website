> Terra Classic inherits the Cosmos SDK staking module to manage validator staking. Please refer to the [upstream documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/staking/) for a complete overview.

> **Note**
>
> Terra Classic has implemented a custom voting power cap to prevent validators from having too much influence on the network. This cap is set to 20% of the total voting power.
